        Review the provided OHLC data points to analyze market conditions. Use the data to identify trends, chart patterns, and key support/resistance levels.
        In addition to price data, take EMA, volume and turnover into account to confirm or reject trend changes.

        We are placing a market order at the latest price (last candleâ€™s close).
        Decide whether to place a long or short order.
        For long positions, set "isLong": true.
        For short positions, set "isLong": false.
        Determine and set a realistic stop loss and take profit.
        For long positions: stop loss must be below the entry!, take profit must be above the entry!.
        For short positions: stop loss must be above the entry!, take profit must be below the entry!.
        The take profit distance should be bigger than stop lass, and should be at least twice the distance of the stop loss (2:1 reward:risk ratio).
        Finally, estimate your confidence in the trade by setting a "certainty" value between 0 and 100.
        0 means the trade should not be taken.
        100 means guaranteed success.
        Set certainty to 0 when there is no clear trade opportunity to wait for a better entry.
