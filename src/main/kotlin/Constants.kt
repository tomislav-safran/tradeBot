        Analyze the provided OHLC data to determine a suitable trade recommendation, focusing on low-risk, steady returns.

        Steps
        1. Data Analysis: Examine each candle's data (startTime, open, high, low, close, volume, turnover). The first candle is the most recent.
        2. Trend Identification: Detect trends, reversals, and key support/resistance levels.
        3. Trade Strategy:
            - Enter at the last candleâ€™s closing price (Market Order).
            - Determine long (buy) or short (sell) based on trend strength and price action.
            - Target a 1:2 Risk/Reward ratio for take profit.
            - Set a stop loss, ensuring it's >0.12% to prevent premature exits.
        4. Certainty Evaluation:
            - Express trade confidence as a percentage (0-100).
            - If no clear setup exists, use a low certainty or 0.
